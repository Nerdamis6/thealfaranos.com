        <h3> Shelby Promoter Wednesday May 21, 2025: Letter to the Editor</h3>
        <h4> Local resident brings workplace concerns to light amid legal filing </h4>
        <p>A local resident and former correctional officer has brought forward a series of workplace concerns following his termination from Crossroads Correctional Center earlier this year — a situation he says has deeply affected his family, his faith, and his standing in the community.Nicholas Alfarano, a resident of Shelby, recently filed a legal complaint in Toole County District Court against CoreCivic, Inc., the national private corrections company that operates the Crossroads facility. While the legal process will ultimately determine the outcome, Alfarano hopes the filing will encourage broader dialogue around employee treatment, religious accommodation, and ethical standards in correctional settings.“More than anything, I want people to understand what it feels like to walk into work with a strong sense of duty — and walk out carrying silence instead of support,” he said. Alfarano, who joined the facility in 2024, describes his experience as both rewarding and difficult.
He says that requests for religious accommodation and respectful treatment were met with long delays and what he viewed as resistance. Ultimately, his time at the facility came to an abrupt end, shortly after the birth of his child. “That was one of the hardest parts,” Alfarano shared. “My wife had just given birth. I was trying to keep my household steady, and suddenly I was trying to explain why I didn’t have a paycheck anymore.”Without speaking to the details of the case, Alfarano says he believes no one should have to choose between their faith, their family, and their job. “This isn’t about revenge or headlines — it’s about principle,” he said. “People should be able to work with dignity.” He hopes that his experience will encourage other employees — across industries — to speak up when something doesn’t feel right, and to trust
the systems in place for reporting and addressing conflict. “No matter how isolated you feel, you are not the only one,” he said. “And it’s never wrong to stand for yourself in a respectful, lawful way.”The matter is now before the court, and Alfarano is allowing the legal process to take its course. In the meantime, he’s focusing on his young family and remaining active in his local community.“I’ve always believed in justice and fairness,” he said. “And if sharing my story brings even a little more of that to the world — that’s something I can stand behind.”
